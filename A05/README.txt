Reflection:
===========
A though assignment. It significantly took me more time to complete due to my attempt to figure out how to translate the selling process into codes. Also, I encountered a difficulty when transforming step 1 codes for step 2: I put all of my codes in main method without creating any other methods. This brought me a lot of inconveniences when I am going to handle ultiple companies - I need to change the way of reading files and need to add for loops to store each list and stack into maps. However, this is a very good practice since it involved most data structures we learned this semester so far.
