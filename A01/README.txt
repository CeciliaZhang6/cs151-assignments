Reflection:
===========
    Although most of the skills required for this assignment are covered by CS113, this is a great refresher for me to pick up what I have learned from last semester and prepare for future assignments. I encountered two main obstacles: figuring out the logic and putting comments. I can easily understand the overall logic, but when it came to detailed steps in PlaceContainer.java, it took me a long time to figure it out. The second challenge is commenting - I have never done this before, so it is a bit hard. However, after realizing how these comments helped me to make the understanding of my codes more solid, I have no complaint. I started this assignment late, which I greatly regret (and I JUST realized I can get extra credit for turning it early!!).
