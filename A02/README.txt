Reflection:
===========
I thought this would be harder than the last assignment, but the fact is actually not. Since it is based on the previous assignment (just a different approach), I did not encounter any huge challenge for the overall outline of this assignment (except understanding the instructions on the website, some sounds confusing to me so I had to read it over and over).


One major challenge was overriding the equals() method. There seems to be something wrong with “@Override” – after getting TA’s help, I realized that the param should only be Object type, and then cast it to Place. Another huge challenge was about my while loop - I did not know that hasNext() method cannot check the file line by line unless I also used getLine() method. 


Also, I finished this assignment early for extra credits (like what I mentioned last time), and I am very proud of myself :)
