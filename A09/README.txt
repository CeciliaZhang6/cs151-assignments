Reflection:
===========
Not a bad programming experience as the last assignment of the semester. I was surprised that my oroginal algorithm actually works and looks organized (programmer's daily life: I don't know why it does not work and I don't know why it does work). Anyway, it was a great experience since I realized that I can have more than one base cases for recursive methods. P.S. Now I start to understand why both recursion and for/while loops exist...in this assignment, recursion is way better than loops.
