Reflection:
===========
This homework assignment made me feel weird. I think I understand the logic to some extent, but now all. I know what I should do in general, but sometimes I am stuck on specific steps such as how to implement a certain function to achieve a small goal.


I also noticed that I need to go to the TA session at least once for each homework assignment. I am not sure if it is normal or not since last semester in CS113 I merely needed outside help.


Thus, I am feeling worried about the midterm. I will try to study and practice more during this weekend. Hope everything is fine (fingers crossed).

Other comments:

I feel weird when I have to ask TA's to help me with reading comprehension since I can barely understand some of the instructions on the class website, and this is not the first assignment that I need to ask someone to check my interpretation.
